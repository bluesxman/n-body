;; time is an event stream.  when time changes all dependencies should be updated.
;; dependencies should subscribe to the time channel.  clock thread which creates
;; the events should publish them to the channel.
;;
;; In effect, signals are channels and lifting a function on a channel creates a
;; subscription using the fn that was passed.

;; choice:  lazy or update all on event

;; event = time -> Some('a)  // If the value of a signal changed at that time, then some 'a else none
;; signal = time -> 'a       // always has a value at a time.  Should it be lazy?  Should it remember?  Should it block if in future?

;; functions take input streams and when a value arrives via that stream the function is immediately evaluated to compute a new output

;; event = instantanous
;; signal = continuous

;; frp limits re-evaluation.  if the signal doesnt change then no things depending on that signal should be re-computed
;; frp avoids polling.  it uses a publish-subscribe model.  changes are pushed to listeners rather than them polling for changes
;; frp uses mutability to efficiently multicast:  eval once and share a ref

;; seems frp retains only the history that is still needed to compute "now" and lets GC clean up history not being used
;; for example, new position depends on velocity now, last position, and delta time therefore most prior positions and velocities
;; would not have a reference and could be GC'd

;; Rx has the scan() method.  Acts similarly to reduce.  Would be useful for representing a position over time
;; given an initial position and velocity signal
